# DinamicArray

ITMO University homework, 2015.

Task: create an array (size is defined by user, has to be more than 0). Initialize every element of the array with number 1. 
Ask user how many elements they want to add to the existing array. If the entered number is positive, add that amount of elements to the array and initialize each one of them with a 0. If it's negative, reduce the amount of elements by that number. If summary of the array length and the entered number is less than or equal to zero (might happen if user enters a negative number), throw an error and ask user to try again.
