# dynamic array

Creates an array (size is defined by user, has to be more than 0). Initializes every element of the array with number 1. 
Asks user how many elements they want to add to the existing array. If the entered number is positive, adds that amount of elements to the array and initializes each one of them with a 0. If it's negative, reduces the amount of elements by that number. If summary of the array length and the entered number is less than or equal to zero (might happen if user enters a negative number), throws an error and ask user to try again.
